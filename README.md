# Magic-Melee-Ranged

## About
This is a simple implementation of a grade-school classic "rock paper scissors", with a twist!

Rather than ```rock```, ```paper```, and ```scissors```, we are using ```magic```, ```melee```, and ```ranged``` instead.

In this game, ```magic > melee```, ```melee > ranged```, ```ranged > magic```. 

These are based on **RuneScape's** combat system.

The player will be playing against a computer opponent.
